- Built SDFGen to convert LiDAR point clouds and reconstructed aircraft models into SDFs (signed distance fields) maps.

- Developed sdfgen\_live (ROS) to integrate live LiDAR/rosbag data during flight and publish an SDF map for online planners while supporting initialization from prior maps for faster startup.

- Validated with static reconstructed aircraft models (B747/B777), flight rosbags, and hardware-in-the-loop on a DJI M300 and achieved 2 Hz SDF generation onboard.

**Languages and tools used:** C++, ROS
