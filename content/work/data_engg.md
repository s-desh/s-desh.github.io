Elucidata accelerates drug discovery by providing standardized data and tools for bioinformaticians. This was my first job after bachelor's and I got to learn and work across the stack from training NLP models to building infrastructure for biomedical data processing. 

**Highlights**

- Engineered AWS-based data-infra (Nextflow, Docker, Terraform) to process 30–100 GB of biomedical datasets, per day.

- Performed research and deployed BERT-based embedding models by building a BioBERT-driven named-entity normalization pipeline and serving it in production.

- Automated daily data ingestion from multiple databanks and built monitoring/tooling for validation, retries, and actionable alerts.

**Languages and tools used:** Python, PyTorch, Docker, Terraform, AWS cloud services
