### About

I'm a grad student studying robotics, currently interested in Motion Planning for robots, 3D Computer Graphics, Computer Vision and Language models. I prefer spending my down time watching movies, trying new food, travelling, reading and touching grass.

Apart from working in tech, I've spent significant chunk of my time exploring design, especially graphic design. So, the intersection of tech and design also interests me and something I want to explore more.
