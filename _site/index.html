<p>I’m a grad student studying robotics, currently interested in Motion Planning for robots, 3D Computer Graphics, Computer Vision and Language models. I prefer spending my down time watching movies, trying new food, travelling, reading and touching grass.</p>

<!-- Apart from working in tech, I've spent significant chunk of my time exploring design, especially graphic design. So, the intersection of tech and design also interests me and something I want to explore more. -->

<!-- Feel free to mail me for ideas and projects to collaborate - sdesh.work@gmail.com -->
