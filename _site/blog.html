      <!-- <p>Learning on the internet involves - searching relevant resources and consuming them in a way that enables meaningful application. Before chatGPT, I’d bounce through multiple websites, maybe watch a video, just to gather enough information on a concept to begin understanding. Now, chatGPT has cut down search time to a fraction, like a librarian who can locate the most obscure texts immediately. Moreover, it also acts like a personal tutor available all the time, allowing you to go back and forth with follow up questions, without the risk of embarrassment.</p>
