    <a class="default-content"><p>Learning on the internet involves - searching relevant resources and consuming them in a way that enables meaningful application. Before chatGPT, I’d bounce through multiple websites, maybe watch a video, just to gather enough information on a concept to begin understanding. Now, chatGPT has cut down search time to a fraction, like a librarian who can locate the most obscure texts immediately. Moreover, it also acts like a personal tutor available all the time, allowing you to go back and forth, without the risk of embarrassment when you ask stupid questions.</p>

<p>Although sometimes outdated, chatGPT spits information at rates higher than humans can grasp and we’re mostly limited by our rate of consumption/understanding. What’s “understanding” is debatable, but for now, we’re certainly far behind computers at consuming and processing information. Work on BCIs (Brain Computer Interfaces) could help break this barrier, where clock rates of humans and machines are in sync. With boundless flow of information between digital and biological neurons, learning will not be constrained by time and opens doors to wild possibilities. If implemented safely, without frying their brains, humans could make decades worth of progress in months.</p>

<p>Enjoy your adventure.</p>
