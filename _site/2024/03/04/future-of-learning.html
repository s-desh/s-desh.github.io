    <a class="default-content"><p>Learning involves - search &amp; understanding. Before chatGPT, I’d bounce through websites, maybe watch a youtube video, just to gather enough information on a concept to begin understanding. Now, chatGPT has cut down search time to a fraction, like a librarian who can locate the most obscure texts immedeatly. Moreover, it also acts like a personal tutor allowing you to go back and forth with follow up questions.</p>

<p>Although sometimes outdated, chatGPT spits information at rates higher than humans could grasp and we’re mostly limited by our rate of consumption/understanding. What is “understanding” could be debatable, but for now, we’re surely far behind computers at consuming information compared to how fast it can be generated. Work on BCIs (Brain Computer Interfaces) could help break this barrier, where clock rates of humans and machines sync. With boundless flow of information between digital and biological neurons learning will not be constrained by time. If implemented safely, humans could make century long advancements in weeks without frying their brains.</p>

<p>Enjoy your adventure.</p>
